   This will return a path where todo list data of lists created by this
   factory can be stored. The path includes the type specifier of the factory
   so each factory has a dedicated location where to store data. The returned
   path is guaranteed to be writable and it exists unless an empty string is
   returned.

           if no fitting location could be found.
