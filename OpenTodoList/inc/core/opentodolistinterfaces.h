     @brief Gives the backend a hint for synchronization

     Unless backends have other means for synchronizing their external data with the internal
     database, they shall implement any syncing in this method. The application will regularly call
     this method.

     If a backend does implement its synchronization solely on its own, it has to provide an
     empty implementation.

     @note It is adviced to use this method to do any expensive syncing instead of implementing
           own means. This is because the application might hook into the host operating system
           to provide ideal points in time for synchronization and hence save e.g. battery when
           running on mobile devices.
